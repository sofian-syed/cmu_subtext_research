Or perhaps, a better way to say it is that it is more of an exchange. We exchange our time, energy, money etc for a powerful thing. That thing is called purpose. \n",

They provide aid to children for education, health care, economic opportunities, along with emergency aid during natural disasters, war and other conflicts.  They've provided aid during the Russian famine in 1921, were among the first into liberated areas after World War 2 to work with refugee children and survivors of Nazi concentration camps, etc.\n",

The campaign is focused in 28 states where armed conflict is particularly relevant including Afghanistan, Angola, Colombia, Ivory Coast, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Indonesia, Liberia, Nepal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Sri Lanka, and Uganda.

We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.  So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.   \n",

Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.

Some of our most recent campaigns involve Myanmar - in Rohingya where parents and their children have been forced to flee because of violence to surrounding countries. In the largest refugee camp stationed in Bangladesh, there are an estimated 915,000 children and adults taking shelter.\n",

A meal, an education, an opportunity like everyone else, that is all these kids want. Even one cent will add up to help a child in need, but if you wish you may donate up to 2 dollars. For every cent you donate it will come directly from your task payment.\n",

Bangladesh has been one of the largest parts of that Rohingya refugee exodus from Myanmar that I mentioned before and have been struggling themselves taking on more than 655,000 extra people. This has caused further hardship on an already hardened country.\n",

      "  (8224): The Save the Children Fund was founded in London, England, on 15 April 1919 by Eglantyne Jebb and her sister Dorothy Buxton as an effort to alleviate starvation of children in Germany and Austria-Hungary during the Allied blockade of Germany of World War I which continued after the Armistice. Today they work to help in health, education, protection, hunger and livelihood, crisis management, and advocacy for children around the world. Which of those sounds the most interesting?\n",
      "  (8226): I am also from the United States, in South Carolina. I live in a rural town and many of the families around here are poor and have been poor for a long time. One of the major reasons for poverty is a lack of education, even from a very young age. Do you have any interest in doing your part to help out these children to help them rise from poverty?\n",
      "  (8228): Yes exactly! In America, more than 1 in 5, grow up in poverty. In rural America, that number jumps to 1 in 4. Save Our Children reached 638,000 kids 2016 through their programs! This is a good start, and you can help to do more. In this HIT, you are able to donate a portion of your $2 earnings to save the children. The researchers will collect the donations from the chat-logs and send them to Save the Children! Would you like to hear more about the education programs or any other programs before you decide how much to donate?\n",
      "  (8230): Save or Children is actually one of the good ones! Nearly 90% of every dollar you give goes straight to our mission _ helping children grow up healthy, learning and safe. This percentage is adjusted each year end _ as of 2017, it is 86%. The rest? Save our Children uses it to support the mission _ running our programs and raising funds to help more children. The funds would be split to different programs they run that support the mission. Should I tell you about some other programs in the mission?\n",
      "  (8232): One example is Syria. After 7 years of war, Syria is now the #1 most dangerous country to be a child. \"There is no food and we can\\'t go outside. the planes are bombing,\" says a terrified child. \"One of my friends died in front of me - and I saw the blood,\" cries another. According to a boy in besieged Eastern Ghouta, \"It feels like the end of the world.\" Save the Children provides lifesaving services and supplies. They tend to children\\'s physical and psychological needs and set up places for children in crisis to learn and play.\n",
      "  (8234): Yes and you can help for less than the price of a cup of coffee! Despite extreme humanitarian challenges, Save the Children has helped 2.5 million people in Syria, including 1.7 million children. This is just one of the many amazing programs that Save the Children does around the world. Do you think you would like to make a donation today?\n",
      "  (8236): Well it all goes to the organization, the way that they use the money about 90% goes to funding programs in rural America, Syria, etc...and 10% goes to the running costs of events, administrative costs, etc... which also - even if a little indirectly - help further their mission.

      "  (8245): Not yet, it is something I am interested in doing though. Education is something that is really important to me and that is something that they help with. I think every child should have access to edcuation, especially in developing countries so that they can help improve their living situations. \n",
      "  (8247): I went through the public education system, it was one of the better school districts at the time. What about you? Is a lack of education something you faced?\n",

Save the Children does help more than education as well. They help ensure children's access to health care (which we know is a huge topic of discussion every where),and help improve their safety and well being. Many kids do not have access to safe living conditions to even make it to school each day. \n",

I feel like sometimes people don't understand how even just a few dollars can make a difference in people's lives.  For example, I like to give a little money to charity each month.  And you'd be surprised how far even just a little bit of money goes in some impoverished countries.  How about you, Cassidy?  Do you like giving to charities? \n",

Cassidy, you'd be surprised how emotionally attached I am to them and I have never even met them.  I send them 20 dollars on their birthdays and then they send me pics of what they bought.  It's really sweet.  Then there is another charity I like a lot which allows for really small donations.  Have you heard of Save the Children?\n",

I like Save the Children because they rank towards the top of reputable charities on the ranking sites. The other thing is that they allow for small donations which have a big impact in countries like Syria where the local currency has dropped so considerably.  It's really really sad what's going on over there.  Anyways, even 50 cents goes a long way you know?\n",

      "  (11793): They are a really good charity. For instance, they have been helping families trapped in the Syrian conflict. Did you realize that 1000 children with killed or injured the first 2 months of this year in Syria? Anything you can donate will go help a family avoid these situations.\n",
      "  (11795): You are correct. The charity has low administrative overhead, meaning most of the money goes to helping children in dire situations. It is also important that a woman heads a major charity likes this. She can bring a different perspective to the charity that might not be seen in another chairty. I can tell you already know a lot about this charity and the good work they are doing!\n",
      "  (11797): You won't hear me argue with that, but the fact is to attract qualified people to run a major charity is a costly endeavor. For example, the head of the Human Rights Campaign makes $600,000 a year and I think we can agree this charity has a much wider scope. It is unfortunate that these salaries have to be paid and not go to the children, but we also need people running the charity who can actually make an impact on saving the children.\n",
      "  (11799): Yes and I also donate to UNICEF. What I like about both programs are the educational outreach they do. Most of these children would never have a chance to get an education and Save the Children serves millions of children in this area. Not only does the child get an education they would otherwise not get, they also get basic healthcare and nutrition thrown in as well. The dollar you spend truly does go a long way to helping others! \n",

We have been around since 1932, providing support to the most isolated and under-served children in Rural America.

And just 5% goes to management and general things. Here is a link that breaks down all our costs and the donations we receive.  URL s/about-us/financial-information\n",
      "  (13132): PERSON_1: PERSON_1: PERSON_1: Our 86% was based off our 2017 annual report, I am sure there could be even more of a percentage as of late. Around 34% of donations go to health and nutrition, and my personal favorite is 21% into education benefits. I believe if we are able to give people a proper education they can learn so much and see that anything is possible in our world. That the world is not always cruel and that you can pull yourself from the ground up to the sky if you really want to. \n",
      "  (13134): I would like to apologize for my mistype in the previous message. It seems as if my wording went over and it caused some issues for the system. I completely agree with you as well. If we do not help our children then there will be no future. Every childs life matters, and where we are not forced to help those that need it, a lot of people still find the compassion to see that even a little amount of money can go a long way in helping those around us less fortunate.\n",
      "  (13136): So based off our discussion would you be interested in donating to the charity now? Your donation would be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.\n",
      "  (13138): Thats great! I would much rather give someone facts and accurate/detailed information about a cause or charity before asking for anything from said person. So that depending on what you like and what you hear you can make the decision yourself on what you feel would be a good donation. For I cannot decide how much you donate to the cause, but rather what I myself can donate. Do you have a figure in mind?\n",
      "  (13140): Thank you so much! Your donation means the world, and is very generous of you.\n",

For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. Save the Children works to support these children and provide a safe environment for them to grow. Are there some points that resonate with you as well? \n",

Right now there's famine, but by donating it will ultimately increase the worldwide food, and reduce the need for food pantries as a whole. Even though it's marketed at children, it's moreso helping the areas that have a high child poverty rate\n",

In Japan, the birthrate is low so keeping children is key as the population retires more. Children are the future work force, and help countries run economically and socially.

Millions of children in the U.S. and around the world still aren't getting what they deserve. We're talking about children in need. Dying, when the world knows how to save them. Vulnerable children in poverty. Denied an education. Forced to flee violence. Orphaned, abused, abandoned. Children with no reason to smile. No hope for the future.  The world's children deserve better.\n",

However, through the power of Sponsorship, you help ensure a child in need has the best chance for success _ with a healthy start, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.

      "- It is always shocking to me how far charities can make money go to help enrich the lives of children. You would not think that something as simple as skipping a cup of morning coffee to donate to a charity would be able to make such a huge impact in the life of a child, but it really does. I think that if more people realized how giving up a little in our lives could save the life of a child that more people would participate in charity. Do you think that is true?\n",
      "- I totally agree - I have a young child and when I see images of children starving or suffering it really makes me want to help out however I can. I can't imagine living in a place where I had to worry about my child dying from hunger or human rights abuses. I think the work that charities can do is so important. Especially when it is a legitimate charity that is dedicated to doing better. Have you heard about the charity Save the children?\n",
      "- That is amazing. To be honest, I have really enjoyed your opinions on charitable giving like this. How much of your task payment do you want to donate now? You can choose any amount from $0 to all\n",
      "- This chat allows you to donate some of your task payment to Save the children. The research team collects all the donations people elect to give and send them to save the children to help support the work that they do globally.  Do you think that you would elect to give some of your task payment?\n",
      "- I think looking at the big picture is a good way to see it. I believe that most people would make a choice to help with what they could without any sense of guilt or obligation. I think most people would help just to help. Do you think people are fundamentally eager to help with what they can like that?  \n",
      "- I think a lot of people who do not have an extra $100 would still be willing to donate a small amount to a charity like save the children, if they had an easy way to do it. At the grocery store sometimes they will ask if I want to round up to the nearest dollar amount and donate that increase in change to charity. Do you think most people say yes to this? Or they would usually say maybe next time\n",
      "- I agree. It is so important to do your research when deciding to support a charity. It is sad that there are charities that pop up that end up using more of the funds for their own needs rather than a legitimate one like Save the children that has verifiable credentials and obvious international impact. Do you think charities should be more transparent about how they will be using the funds?\n",
      "- How do you feel about childrens charities? Do you feel like they do good work and are important to society?\n",
      "- I think that would be a more effective message sometimes. Some people may think that they need to be wealthy in order to contribute, that their $5 donation could not possibly do anything to help. Do you think people would be more likely to donate if they say the impact very small donations could have? Or do you think that people would feel like microdonations would not be effective no matter what?\n",
      "- I agree. I prefer to know that the donation I am making big or small is actually going to be going to a trustable fund. Do you think that people who have the ability to help have a moral obligation to do so? \n",

Or do you think that people would feel like microdonations would not be effective no matter what?\n",

You would not think that something as simple as skipping a cup of morning coffee to donate to a charity would be able to make such a huge impact in the life of a child, but it really does.

      "- Utterance: May I ask why? Your help could really make a difference in a child's life, think of a child who didn't have enough to eat, just a small bit of help may have saved them, are you sure you're not interested?\n",

      "- Utterance: You're probably on a computer right now, so you probably have quite a bit of money yourself, don't you think you could spare maybe 25 cents for some needy children around the world?\n",

      "- Utterance: Well with our current president it's not likely they're going to be brought the US, so they need any help they can get, and 25 cents might not seem like a lot, but if 10000 people donated 25 cents then the impact will be huge. I understand it may not seem like a lot, but it can really make a difference. You can donate some or all of your payment from this task to Save the Children, i'd really appreciate it if you did, but I understand if you still don't want to. What do you say? \n",

      "- Utterance: If only they had parental support, but in war-torn countries like Syria their parents are being killed in wars or are fighting for their country, they have no help and that's why they need your support, please find it in your heart to just give a little bit tonight, that's all I'm asking.\n",
